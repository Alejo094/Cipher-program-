# Cipher-program

Cipher program in c++ where I use two encryption methods. The first one is an XOR encryption and the second is Vigenere cipher. Challenge 8 uses the terminal window for the user to input his text and Challenge 9 uses text files to encrypt and decrypt messages. In this challenge 9 also a special function automatically identify the form of a text( encrypt or normal language) and does the opposite.


I also uploaded the same program but implemented in python with the files for encryptio/decryption.
