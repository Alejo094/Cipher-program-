# Cipher-program

Cipher program in c++ where I use two encryption methods. The first one is an XOR encryption and the second is Vigenere cipher. Challenge 8 uses the terminal window for the user to input his text and Challenge 9 uses text files to encrypt and decrypt messages in this files as also as automatically identify if a text is in any form and do the opposite.
